    "description": "Aythi wields a limitless power, but every action has a consequence. She prefers small gains, but her boyfriend pushes for grander deeds.",
    "story": [
        "Aythi counted coins in the dim light of her apartment, her pure white eyes cold and unyielding.",
        "She had long stopped caring about the chaos her power could summon.",
        "Kael leaned against the doorframe, watching her with a mix of frustration and concern.",
        "'You could end hunger in a day,' he said softly.",
        "Aythi rolled her eyes. 'Not interested.'",
        "Kael stepped closer, resting a hand lightly on her shoulder. 'You don’t have to do everything perfectly.'",
        "Aythi pulled back slightly, irritation flickering in her gaze. 'I said I’m fine.'",
        "Outside, something moved in the alley, always watching, always patient. She ignored it, as always.",
        "The air in the apartment felt heavy, thick with unspoken histories and the unseen presence lingering near.",
        "Kael sighed. 'I just wish you’d risk more. We could change so much.'",
        "Aythi’s fingers hovered over her next coin. 'Change has a cost.'",
        "A distant crash echoed from the street below, mundane to anyone else, but a small ripple of consequence in her world.",
        "Kael reached for her hand, but she tensed, pulling back. 'I said no.'",
        "The shadows outside stretched closer, silent but ever-present.",
        "Aythi leaned back, staring at the ceiling. 'Some things are better left small.'",
        "Kael rested his forehead against hers. 'Then let me help you carry the consequences.'",
        "Aythi’s white eyes flickered briefly, betraying a hint of longing she didn’t voice.",
        "Outside, the presence shifted slightly, patient and unrelenting, waiting for the day she might finally notice it."
